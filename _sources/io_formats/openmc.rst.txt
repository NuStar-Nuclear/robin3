``openmc_compatible`` dict
==========================
``openmc_compatible`` dictionary contains parameters used in conversion from ROBIN3 
model to OpenMC model. This dictionary should be added to :ref:`ROBIN3 input model 
<io_file_formats_input>` with its key named "openmc_compatible" in input model dictionary.
For example::

    materials:
      ...

    assemblies:
      ...
    
    structures:
      ...

    state_points:
      ...

    openmc_compatible:
      volume: robin3
      tallies:
      - current
      - assembly-kappa
      optimize: true
      nuclide_density: openmc

----------------
``tallies`` list
----------------
``tallies`` is a list indicating which tallies should be generated in OpenMC model. 
``tallies`` can contain following members:
    
    :pin-power:
        If this string is contained in ``tallies`` list, ``'kappa-fission'`` of every pin cell
        will be tallied. Volumes of all cells filled by fissionable material will be calculated
        to deduce power density.
    :flux:
        If this string is contained in ``tallies`` list, ``'flux'`` of every tagged cell (converted
        from tagged region in ROBIN3 model) and ``'heating-local'`` accumulated in the whole model
        will be tallied. Volumes of all fissionable materials will be calculated, along with ``'heating-local'``
        tallied, to deduce the :ref:`normalization factor <openmc:usersguide_tally_normalization>` for obtaining 
        absolute flux.
    :current:
        If this string is contained in ``tallies`` list, ``'current'`` and ``'flux'`` on each
        surface of every square assembly in the core model will be tallied. Do not support 
        hexgonal core because OpenMC has not implemented this functionality.
    :assembly-kappa:
        If this string is contained in ``tallies`` list, ``'kappa-fission'`` of each assembly
        will be tallied. Currently only works when the model is a square core. Hexgaonal core
        kappa fission will be implemented soon.

Default to empty (no tallies if no member in the ``tallies`` list).

-------------------
``optimize`` option
-------------------
``optimize`` option is a boolean. If this option is on, ROBIN3's OpenMC Compatibility module 
will try to remove redundant boundaries and regions in conversion of geometry. Default to true.

-----------------
``volume`` option
-----------------
``volume`` option has either ``'robin3'`` or ``'openmc'`` as its value. It decides whether use
OpenMC or ROBIN3 to calculate volumes. ROBIN3's volume calculation is much faster and more precise
than OpenMC. However, currently ROBIN3 can only calculate volumes before geometry pre-processing
which may lead to totally wrong results because regions may be divided in pre-processing if crossing
cell boundaries. Default to ``'openmc'``.

--------------------------
``nuclide_density`` option
--------------------------
``nuclide_density`` option has whether ``'robin3'`` or ``'openmc'`` as its value. It decides whether
use OpenMC data library or ROBIN3 data library to calculate nuclide densities of materials.
If a ROBIN3 material contains sub material with S(α,β), this option must be assigned ``'robin3'``, because
:meth:`openmc:openmc.Material.mix_materials` currently does not support mix materials with S(α,β).
