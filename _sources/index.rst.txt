Welcome to ROBIN3's documentation!
==================================

ROBIN3 is a GPU-based 2D neutron transport code for reactor physics criticality calculations,
it is capable of simulating 2D assembly and full-core reactor models with high-performance 
based on its GPU solver. Features and methodology of ROBIN3 are:

    AP1000 and VVER simulation
    
Cross section library:
    - 69 or 172 groups library mainly processed from ENDF/B-VII.0.
Resonance treatment:
    - Two-term rational approximation to generate the effective cross sections for infinite lattice;
    - The enhanced neutron current method to generate the position dependent Dacoff factor;
    - Pre-tabulated resonance interference factor table to account for the resonance interference effect among multiple resonance nuclides.
MOC transport calculation:
    - Able to model both square and hexagonal fuel assemblies;
    - Assembly-based modular ray generation;
    - GPU-based parallel ray tracing;
Fuel depletion calculation:
    - Linear rate (LR) method for normal fuel pins;
    - Logarithmic linear reaction rate (LLR) method for gadolinium-bearing fuel pins.
